				<h5>We don't just teach maths but inspire and build confidence.</h5>
				<br>
				<p>One of the most common reasons for getting tuition is because a student has fell out of touch of a topic and has hence lost confidence in it. We aim to rebuild this, to inspire and get them back on track. If this is the case it is worth getting in contact and we can discuss a potential plan to regain this confidence.

				We specialise in the unachievable, please don't be afraid to get in contact no matter the time frame or difficulty of the task we will give it our best shot.
